there are two ways to fix the CORS Error
1- Add proxy to package.json file in the frontend "proxy": "http://localhost:4000",
    it sends to request to server from server address, it just work only in development

2- use npm cors

3- if auth is required in our app, we need to modify all fetch funcs in frontend
